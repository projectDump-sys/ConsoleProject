# ConsoleProject
This is a repository for my console projects while doing computer programming from high school, all projects will likely be in C#, as I really don't care to learn anything else.
If you would like to use this code for any purpose, you are permitted to do so, however if you do end up using my code I would appreciate if you credited me for it. Deepseek AI is used in this project, however it is not used to create story elements or mechanics within my programs, it is merely used to assist with implementation of my ideas.

A thanks to hellscaped for offering their help in this project, and assisting me with learning how to add my projects to github, as well as many other small contributions they've made.
